### A 2-D Platformer Based On Supernatural
***
##About
In its simplest form, spnmario is a free, fan-made Supernatural video game.  It's also an effort to create a readily modifiable open-source 2-D platformer to reduce effort in the creation of free fangames.  It utilizes the XNA 4.0 libraries for C#.

## History
* In 2010, The Disco King created [an 8-bit cover](http://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/how-kansass-carry-on-wayward-son-went-8-bit-252939) of Carry On My Wayward Son.
* In 2011, istehlurvz posted the cover to [tumblr](http://istehlurvz.tumblr.com/post/2494094291/just-press-play-and-picture-to-yourself-a), excitedly suggesting listeners imagine themselves in a classic mario-type game set in the world of Supernatural.
* The post bounced around for a while, as tumblr posts do.  A few users created fanart suggesting potential gameplay, but no one seemed devoted to making it a reality.  
* On March 30th, the post appeared on my dash.  Since I'm familiar with a broader definition of fanworks than most, I became interested in making this a reality, and shortly afterward got to work on the first parts of the game.  
* On April 16th, the milestones for the SuperAlpha/proof-of-concept release were met.

## Help Out
spnmario needs more than coders.  Artists, musicians, writers, and level designers are all encouraged to help out.  Feel free to fork the project to add your contributions, or contact scarbunkle, either here or on tumblr.  Additional details and specifications will appear on the Wiki.  
 

## Technical
The game is going to be written in C#, using the XNA 4.0 libraries.  Why?  Because despite Microsoft ending support for it, XNA represents a pretty simple way of writing games, that manages to run relatively efficiently.  More importantly, though, I know how to use it.
