### A 2-D Platformer Based On Supernatural
***
## History
* In 2010, The Disco King created [an 8-bit cover](http://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/how-kansass-carry-on-wayward-son-went-8-bit-252939) of Carry On My Wayward Son.
* In 2011, istehlurvz posted the cover to [tumblr](http://istehlurvz.tumblr.com/post/2494094291/just-press-play-and-picture-to-yourself-a), excitedly suggesting listeners imagine themselves in a classic mario-type game set in the world of Supernatural.
* The post bounced around for a while, as tumblr posts do.  A few users created fanart suggesting potential gameplay, but no one seemed devoted to making it a reality.  
* On March 30th, the post appeared on my dash.  Since I'm familiar with a broader definition of fanworks than most, I became interested in making this a reality, and shortly afterward got to work on the first parts of the game.

## Technical
The game is going to be written in C#, using the XNA 4.0 libraries.  Why?  Because despite Microsoft ending support for it, XNA represents a pretty simple way of writing games, that manages to run relatively efficiently.  More importantly, though, I know how to use it.
